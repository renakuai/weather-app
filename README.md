# weather-app
Created a weather app to practice ReactJS themes / styled components and CSS animations.

Created this weather app where the background animations and app styling changes depending on the weather condition category of the location searched. There are primarily 4 basic themes: Clear, Rain, Snow, and Overcast. Theme changes were done using styled-component themes and animations and art were mainly created using CSS. I also utilized React Reducer because I wanted to learn it, but it was completely unnecessary for this project.
